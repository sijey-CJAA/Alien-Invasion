# Alien-Invasion
Project Overview

Alien-Invasion is an arcade-style shooting game implemented with Pygame. The player controls a ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and shoots projectiles to destroy waves of incoming aliens. The project is designed for the Data Communications and Algorithms course: it demonstrates core game-programming techniques while linking key algorithmic concepts and simple data-communications analogies.
